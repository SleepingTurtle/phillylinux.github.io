already an enthusiast or want to learn more, come and join
the Philadelphia Linux Users Group for an evening of technology
talk and microbrewed beer.</p>

<p>We will be meeting from 7:00 pm until everyone feels like
leaving.  We hope to have more "PLUG West" events in the future,
so if you'd like to see more Linux happenings in the Western
suburbs, please join us and make your voice heard.
