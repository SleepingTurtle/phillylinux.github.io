<p>     Interested in Linux, BSD, and Free Software?  Whether you're
        already an enthusiast or want to learn more, come and join
        the Philadelphia Linux Users Group for a social evening of
        technology talk, food, and microbrewed beer.  We'll be
        meeting at The Drafting Room in Exton on Thursday, March 15,
        2007, starting at 7:00 pm.  (Even you're under 21, you are
        welcome to attend.)
</p>
<p>
        We've been having PLUG West meetings for a full year now, and
        it's been a great success.  The original kick-off was in
        March of last year, so what better way to celebrate this
        anniversary than another Biernacht?
</p>
<p>
        Our agenda for the evening is simple:
</p>

<pre>
                1.0: Introductions
                2.0: PLUG overview, upcoming meetings
                3.0: Open social forum; get to know your fellow geeks

        {0,1,2,3}.5: Beer! (also food and conviviality)
</pre>

<p>If you plan to attend, R.S.V.P. is requested but not required. (We'd like to have an estimate of how many people to expect.) Just drop an email to <a href="mailto:rsvp@phillylinux.org">rsvp@phillylinux.org</a>.</p>
