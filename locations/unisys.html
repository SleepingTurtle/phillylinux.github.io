<p>There are two building on the campus.  The meeting will be held in 
the main building, which is the larger of the two.  You will be able to
enter the Unisys parking lot from Swedesford Road (look for the big, red
Unisys sign).  Please enter through the main entrance on the North side
of the building.</p>

<p>Attendees can register at the door (for security purposes only), but
Unisys has requested that we provide a list of as many attendees as
possible prior to the event.  If you plan to attend, we ask that
you send an email to rsvp@phillylinux.org, though this is not required.</p>

<p>A security guard will be at the front desk, and someone will escort
you to the conference room where the meeting will be held.</p>

<p>After a meeting at Unisys, many attendees head over to <a
href="tjs.html">TJ's Restaurant and Drinkery</a> to continue the
conversation over beer.

<p>
The Malvern and Paoli Septa R5 Exton stations (see the
<a href="http://septa.org/service/sched/r5s_wk.html">weekday schedule</a>)
are closest to the site, but they are not within convenient walking
distance.  If you would like to attend but can only use public
transportation, please send a note to the <a
href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion
list</a> and someone will probably be able to pick you up.
