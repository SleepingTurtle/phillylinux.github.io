<hr><h2>To Participate</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download.html">Download</a> and install gpg.

<li><a href="http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/gpg-party.html#ss3.5">Generate
your key pair</a> (gpg --gen-key) (I suggest leaving the "comment" field blank).

<li>Email your public key to <a
href="mailto:mct/at/phillylinux/dot/org">Michael Toren</a> (preferably at least a week before a meeting).

<li>Print out, verify and initial a copy of your fingerprint (gpg
--fingerprint). You will bring copies of your fingerprint with you to the
keysigning, and hand them out to everyone you wish to keysign with.

<li>(<b>optionally</b>) <a href="secrets.html">email a secret/password to each participant.</a>

<li>Bring photo ID (drivers licence / passport) and verified
fingerprint to a <a href="http://www.PhillyLinux.org">PLUG</a> or <a
href="http://www.cjfearnley.com/pads/">PADS</a> meeting.

</ul>

<p>To get your public key into a file to email me, do something like
"<kbd>gpg -a --export &gt; file</kbd>".  This will write all public keys
you have to "<kbd>file</kbd>" -- you can specify your email address to
only write your own key.

<p>To get a copy of your fingerprint to print (or write) out &amp;
verify to bring to the meeting, do "<kbd>gpg --fingerprint</kbd>".
It should look something like this (the part you need to verify is in bold):

<pre>
pub  1024D/0E9FF879 2000-09-05 Darxus &lt;Darxus@ChaosReigns.com&gt;
     Key fingerprint = <b>DE37 8846 3B06 B97C F661  D68F 7FB5 B0BE 0E9F F879</b>
sub  1024g/2EEAB976 2000-09-05 </pre>

<p>Be sure to print out enough slips with your own fingerprint information
on them, to exchange with whomever you wish to keysign with.

<p>It would be a good idea to make sure that you get an email
responce from me to be sure I didn't miss your email.  Ideally,
you should verify that your key has been added to the <a
href="http://www.phillylinux.org/keys/phillylinux.gpg">keyring</a>
by doing the following, using your email address instead of mine:
<p><tt>
wget http://www.phillylinux.org/keys/phillylinux.gpg<br>
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./temp.gpg --import phillylinux.gpg<br>
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./temp.gpg --list-keys darxus@chaosreigns.com<br>
</tt>

<p>If it lists your key, something like this, then it worked:<br><tt>
pub  1024D/0E9FF879 2000-09-05 Darxus &lt;Darxus@ChaosReigns.com&gt;<br>
sub  1024g/2EEAB976 2000-09-05<br></tt>

<p>If you get something like "<tt>gpg: error reading key: public key not found</tt>", then your key has not been imported and you need to talk to me.

<hr>

<h2>After the Meeting</h2>
After verifying identities at the meeting, you will recieve an email with directions on how to sign the keys you verified and send them back to me.  (<a href="keysigning.followup.txt">example directions</a>).
