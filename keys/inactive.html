<h1>Inactive Keys</h1>

As of May of 2002, people have participated in our keysignings with 39
keys.  The printout of all of these fingerprints is currently 4 pages,
times something like 24 copies.  14 of these keys have not participated
in any of the 3 keysignings in this year.  I have moved these inactive
keys to the inactive.gpg file, and notified the owners of all of these
keys via all of the email addresses on each key, and informed them that
if they would like to participate in a keysigning, they need to contact
me to let me know that their fingerprint needs to be printed.

<p>Inactive keys are still counted in all graphs and statistics.
