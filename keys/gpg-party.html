<H2><A NAME="toc1">1. Overview of the Party</A></H3>
<B><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What exactly is a key signing party?</A></B>

<P>A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP
encryption system with the purpose of allowing those people to
sign each others keys.  Key signing parties serve to extend the web
of trust to a great degree.  Key signing parties also serve as
great opportunities to discuss the political and social issues
surrounding strong cryptography, individual liberties, individual
sovereignty and even implementing encryption technologies or perhaps
future work on free encryption software.

<BR>

<P><B><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is key signing?</A></B>

<P>Key signing is act of digitally signing a public
key.  You can digitally sign your own public key, or
another entity's public key. Key signing is done to verify
that a given public key really does belong to the entity that
appears to own the key.  In a sense, key signatures validate a
public keys. This is the way in which key signing builds the
web of trust.

<P><B><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is a web of trust?</A></B>

<P>A web of trust is a term used to describe the trust
relationships between a group of keys.  A key signature
is a link, or strand if you will, in the web of trust.
The web of trust can be thought of as the sum of all the
links between all key holding parties. Links can be
bidirectional or only 1 way.  The ideal web of trust is
one in which everyone is connected bidirectionally to
everyone else.  In effect, everyone trusts that every key
does in fact belong to its owner. The web of trust can be
thought of as the sum of all the links between all key
holding parties.

<P><B><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Can you give me an example of the application of key signatures?</A></B>

<P>As an example, let's say that Alice and Bob generate PGP
Keys with GPG and hold a PGP key signing party. At the party
Alice and Bob go verify each others' key information and later
sign each others' keys.  GPG by default automatically signs the
public key of every pair it generates with the associated
private key.  So, Alice and Bob both now have at least two
signatures validating that their keys belong to them.  Alice's
key was signed by Alice herself and Bob and Bob's key was signed
by Bob himself and Alice.  In the future Alice and Bob meet Cathy.
Cathy generates a key pair and tells Alice and Bob that she will
send them her key.  Alice doesn't like Cathy and doesn't want Bob
to exchange encrypted communications with her. Both Alice and Cathy
generate GPG keys which they claim belong to Cathy.  They both send
them to Bob.  Both keys have one signature, the signature of the
associated private key.  Bob does not know which key is really
Cathy's.   Cathy hears that Bob got two keys, and suspects Alice.
She decides to forge an email to Bob from Alice telling him that
Alice has generated new keys and enclosing the public key.  However,
Bob knows for sure this is a trick because even though Bob now has
two keys for Alice, one of the keys has been signed by multiple
people (himself and Alice) verifying that it does indeed belong
to Alice, while the other key - Cathy's fake key - only has its
own signature.

<P>The above example is very simplified and things can get a lot
more complicated than that.  You can read through the PGP FAQs
or a good book on PKI for more information and a more detailed
explanation.  The above example does clearly explain the basics
of key signing and its value.  Cathy was not able to introduce
a fake key pair because of the web of trust interconnections
between Bob and Alice.  Signatures and webs of trust do not
guarantee trustable keys.  For example, when Bob and Alice
first met Cathy, lets say that a friend of Cathy's Donald had
been with Cathy.  Donald could have generated fake key pairs for
Alice and Bob, signed them with his key and signed both pairs
of keys with the other pairs resulting in three signatures on
each key and send them to Cathy.  Cathy would be facing a
series of bad keys and signatures.  How could key signing help
Cathy resist such an attack?  Well, let's say that all the
people involved where exchanging keys through a key server.
If Cathy searched the key server for Alice and Bob's keys,
she'd find two sets for both Alice and Bob.  If Alice and Bob
collected twenty key signatures at the keysigning party, it's
obvious that Cathy can better trust the public keys signed
twenty times than the ones signed only three times.  Cathy
should know something's up from the existence of the extra
public keys - so she can look for closely at the generation
dates and the trust web behind the public keys.  The twenty
keys from the party signatures should all be signed twenty
or more times and have widely varying generation times, most
likely all the keys which signed Alice and Bob's keys where
also signed by other keys.  That would not be the case if
Donald had generated twenty faked key pairs and generated a
faked web of trust.


<P><B><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Why should I hold my own key signing parties?</A></B>

<P>There are three primary reasons to hold as many key signing parties
as you possibly can.

<P>First, and perhaps most importantly, you should hold as many key signing
parties as possible in order to expand the web of trust.  The more deep and
tightly inter-linked the web of trust is, the more difficult it is to
defeat.

<P>Second, key signing parties help others get integrated into the security
culture and encourage them to gain an understanding of PGP and related strong
cryptography technologies.  In order to get the benefits of strong cryptography,
people must use strong cryptography, and use it properly.

<P>Finally, key signing parties help build communities.  They help
techies get together to get to know each other, network, and discuss
important issues like civil liberties, cryptorights, and internet
regulation. Discussion is important because discussion is not only the first
step as also the step before action.  At the time I'm authoring this document
there are not very many complex webs of trust in the world.  If you work
to build a web of trust in your local area, it is very likely that the
first participants in that web will be the leaders and policy setters of
the internet community in your area.  They are the individuals who can
choose to build secure strong cryptographic technology and protocols into
the local infrastructure if they so choose.  The integration of such
technology and protocols could make issues like the FBI's carnivore
system technologically infeasible and therefore moot.

<H2><A NAME="toc2">2. Organizing The Party</A></H2>

<P><B><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Role of the Coordinator</A></B>

<P>It's not very difficult to organize and coordinate a key
signing party.  However, aside from the regular tasks of inviting people,
picking a location and setting a time, the Coordinator does
have some other key signing specific responsibilities.  Those
usually include providing a key list for each participant and
determining the structure of the party.

<P><B><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 How should the party be structured?</A></B>

<P>There are two primary ways that a PGP key signing party can be
structured -- in a centralized way or in a decentralized way.  The best
approach to the key signing can be determined by the number of people
that will be attending and the atmosphere of the location where you're
holding your party.  The basic requirements of the party are that the
participants are able to verify each others' keys and that the the
participants are able to verify each others' identities.  Given that
those basic requirements are met, the coordinator can come up with some
variation of the two types.

<P>A centralized party would be a more organized affair which would
work well with small to medium numbers of people.  The participants
would send their key information to the coordinator who would compile
it into a list.  Each participant, upon arriving at the party, would
be given a copy of the key list.  Each participant would then be called
on by the coordinator.  The participant then checks their key fingerprint
against the fingerprint on the sheet that the coordinator gave them.  If
the participant is sure that their key is the same as the key on the
sheet then the participant reads their fingerprint aloud so that the other
party participants can make sure they also have the correct matching fingerprint.
If they do in fact have the correct matching fingerprint, they check it off on their
sheet.  This is necessary to make sure that the coordinator has not made a
mistake in the generation of the sheet or has not slipped a sheet in with
a faked key to one or more of the participants.  After everyone has checked
off the participant's key, the coordinator then calls on the next participant,
and so on.  After all of the keys have been verified, the participants and
coordinator are asked to form a long single file line while holding their
IDs in front of them.  The person at the head of the line walks down the line
and checks each person's ID.  If their ID is correct and the person walking
down the line has a check next to the individual in the line's key verifying
that they had said it was their key at the beginning of the party, he places
a second check mark on his list.  Once a key has two check marks it can be signed.

<P>A decentralized party would basically be every man for himself.  Participants
are expected to mingle informally and find other participants who's keys
they have not signed yet.  Upon meeting they verify their keys on
each other's lists and validate each other's ID.  Decentralized parties
allow many more people to be easily include but also have the down side
of making it easy for some participants not to validate each other's
keys for future signing.  At a decentralized party, it is important for
the coordinator to encourage everyone to make sure that they do meet
with everyone else for key validation.  While a list of keys and finger
prints does not necessary need to be produced for a decentralized party,
it is still good practice.

<P>Centralized parties are great for key signing parties at conferences
during lunch, informal quiet meetings at some one's home or a restaurant
etc.  Decentralized key signing parties are much more practical for
parties that will include a very large number of people, take place
in a bar or other noisy area, or parties including particularly rowdy
and difficult to control geeks.

<P><B><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Announcing the party</A></B>

<P>The larger the party the better.  You can announce your party to
your local LUG email list, other computer related lists you're on
in the area, even place an ad in the news paper or issue a press
release.

<P>If you're just starting to build the web of trust in your
area, it's a good idea to try and get other active PGP users
involved because they are the ones who are most likely to
hold key signing parties of their own in the future.  Good ways
find such people are to talk with others who've sent email to lists
you're on with PGP signatures, or by searching the keyserver
networks for keys with email addresses specific to your local
area.  For example, email addresses that end in the domains of
university or large company which are located in your area often
yield very high numbers of interested parties.

<P><B><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Generating the key lists</A></B>

<P>If you're going to use a party structure that calls for
the participants to have lists of the keys of everyone
attending the party, the coordinator needs to generate such
a list a list.  This list should be compiled in a format
similar to this:

<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Key ID</TD><TD>Key Owner</td><TD>Key Fingerprint</TD><TD>Key Size</TD><TD>Key Type</TD><TD>Key Info Matches?</TD><TD>Owner ID Matches?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>992A4B3F</TD><TD>V. Alex Brennen  &#60; vab@cryptnet.net &#62; </TD><TD>0EC8 B0E3 052D FC4C 208F 76EB FA92 0973 992A 4B3F</TD><TD>1024</TD><TD>DSA</TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>A copy of this list should then be printed out for each of
the people who will be attending the key signing party.  The
coordinator can print the copies of the list himself, or he
can email the list or place it on the web for the attendees
to print.

<P>You should not bring a computer to the party because
binary replacement or system modifications are very
easy ways to compromise PGP systems.

<P>If someone where to bring a portable computer and
everyone used that computer to sign the other keys at
the party, no one would know if the machine had been
running a key stroke logging utility, a modified version
of GPG or a specially modified keyboard, any of which
could be used to capture the secret keys of those who
used the computer.

<P>The use of a computer at the party would also leave
you open to more simple attacks like shoulder-surfing,
or more complex attacks like infection with virii that
modify your GPG binaries to leak future secret keys
discretely.

<BR>
<BR><B><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 How to generate your Key pair</A></B>

<P>1)  Go to www.gnupg.org and download the latest version of gnupg: gnupg-x.x.x.tar.gz

<P>4)  Get a floppy to store your keys on and format it.

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0
</CODE>

<P>4a) Mount the floppy and make a directory on it owned by you
    for your keys:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ mount /mnt/floppy
<BR>[vab@firster vab]$ mkdir /mnt/floppy/.gnupg
<BR>[vab@firster vab]$ chown vab:vab /mnt/floppy/.gnupg
</CODE>

<P>4b) Make a symlink from your home dir to the floppy

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ ln -s /mnt/floppy/.gnupg .gnupg
</CODE>

<P>5)  Generate your gnupg keys

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --gen-key
</CODE>

<P>5a) Select the key types you want - The default is good.

<BR>
<P><CODE>
Please select what kind of key you want:
<BR>   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
<BR>   (2) DSA (sign only)
<BR>   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
<BR>Your selection? &#60;return&#62;

<BR>
<BR>Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?  O&#60;return&#62;
</CODE>

<P>5e) Choose a pass phrase.  You need to pick a good one.  It should be
    long and very difficult to guess.  It should be something you won't
    forget.  If you forget your pass phrase, you cannot recover your key.

<P>5f)  Move the mouse and hit some keys maybe update locate in the
     background or run a big find.  GPG is reading from /dev/random
     to get some randomness for your key generation. /dev/random is
     populated in part by interrupts.

<P>6)  Modify your key if you want.  For example if you have multiple email
    addresses and you want to list them as valid on your key:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --list-secret-keys
<BR>
<BR>/home/vab/.gnupg/secring.gpg
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>sec  1024D/C01BAFC3 2000-09-21 Demo User &#60;demo@noexistant.nowhere&#62;
<BR>ssb  2048g/7A4087F3 2000-09-21
<BR>[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --edit-key C01BAFC3
<BR>Command> help
<BR>Command> adduid
<BR>[...]
<BR>Command> save
</CODE>

<P>7) Send your key to the keyserver:
<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --keyserver &#60;keyserver&#62; --send-key &#60;Your_Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>You should see a success message like this:
<BR>
<P><CODE>
gpg: success sending to `keyserver.cryptnet.net' (status=200)
</CODE>

<P>8)  Email your info to the Coordinator telling
    him that you're coming to the key signing party.

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --fingerprint  &#60;Your_Key_ID&#62; | mail coordinator@hostname.domain -s \
"My Key info for the party"
</CODE>

<P>9)  Umount the floppy and eject it:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ umount /mnt/floppy
</CODE>

<P>Note:  You can carry the floppy around with you for additional security,
or you can just leave it in a safe, locked desk drawer etc.  You DO NOT
want to have your .gnupg directory containing your keys in a location
accessible over the internet.

<P>10) Show up at the party.
<BR><BR>

<BR><B><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 How To Sign Keys</A></B>

<P>Step 1:   Get a copy of the key

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --keyserver &#60;keyserver&#62; --recv-keys  &#60;Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>GPG will download the key from the keyserver into your public key
ring.  If you get a read error, it means the keyserver is overloaded.
Please, try again in a few seconds.

<P>Step 2:  Fingerprint and Verify the key

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --fingerprint &#60;Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>GPG will print out the fingerprint of the Key with &#60;Key_ID &#62; (the key
you just downloaded).  Check the fingerprint against the checklist
that you where given at the party.  Note: Don't check the fingerprint
on your checklist against the fingerprint on the web page as the server
may not send you the same key it displays on the web page.

<P>Step 3:  Sign the key

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --sign-key &#60;Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>If you have multiple private keys, you can specify which of your private
keys to sign the other persons public key with like this:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --default-key &#60;Key_to_use&#62; --sign-key &#60;Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>If you have trouble dealing with RSA keys, you're probably using an old
version of gnupg.  The current version of gnupg is version 1.0.3, versions
older that 1.0.3 do not include RSA support.  1.0.3 was released a few
days ago.  Note:  You may have to uninstall an older version if your
distribution installed it with package management software (ex: RH6.2).
You can check the version you're executing like this:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --version
</CODE>

<P>Step 4:  Upload the signed key or sent it to the owner

<P>It's important to note here that some people would consider
it rude to upload their public key to a server.  This is because
some people believe that keeping their public key secret adds an
extra degree of security to their encrypted communications.  This
is true, because a keyserver could be broken or compromised
and return the incorrect public key when queried.  It is also
true because the public key of a key pair is needed to carry out
certain types of attacks against the public key cryptosystems
which pgp uses. While many people expect, with reasonably large
keysizes, that these attacks are so extremely unlikely to be
successful that is does not matter if the public key is broadcast,
keeping the public key secret does in fact strengthen the key pair.

<P>I don't recommend that you keep your public key secret as it
will discourage others from using PGP in their communications
with you.  To address the issue of the possibility of a
compromised or broken keyserver returning an invalid key
you can take steps to protect yourself from having messages
sent to you encrypted with invalid keys, such as publishing
your key's fingerprint in your .signature file or on your web
page.  To address the concern about the attacking of your
key pair though your publicly available public key, I would
say that if you are very concerned about the strength of your
keypair or truly paranoid about the secrecy of your communications,
you could generate additional keypairs for each communication
and exchange the public keys of those keypairs though encrypted
communications with the individual you'll be communicating with.


<P>You can send the signed key back to the keyserver like this:

<BR>
<P><CODE>
[vab@firster vab]$ gpg --keyserver &#60;keyserver&#62; --send-key &#60;Key_ID&#62;
</CODE>

<P>You should see a success message like this:
<BR>
<P><CODE>
gpg: success sending to `keyserver.cryptnet.net' (status=200)
</CODE>
