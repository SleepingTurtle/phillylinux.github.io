<title>keysigning secrets</title>
<body>

The purpose of a keysigning party is to verify the identities of other
participants, so that you can then sign their public key to signify that
you have verified their identities.

<p>This is why we pass around photo IDs to verify the names listed on keys.
But that does not verify the email address on the key.

<p>If you wish to consider the email address on the key as part of the
identity that you are verifying, then you can email a secret/password to each
email address listed in the key before the keysigning party, and then ask the
person to read off the secret/password in person at the keysigning party.

<p>This is particularly useful for people who do not include a name matching
their photo ID in their key.

<p>A list of all keys (including email addresses) which will be participating
in keysignings can be found <a href="./#members">on this page</a>.
