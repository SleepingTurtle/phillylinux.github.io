Subject: [PLUG] Biglumber - new key signing site


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


Since PLUG is definitely the most "crypto-aware" LUG that I know of, 
I'd like to announce my new site here:

http://www.biglumber.com/

Biglumber is an attempt to centralize announcements of key signings, 
be it by a group (such as PLUG), a one-time affair (such as USENIX), 
or just by people who are willing to exchange keys if geographically 
close. All feedback and comments welcome, of course, and I highly 
encourage everyone who uses GPG to add a listing (and of course, 
for someone *cough*Darxus*cough* to add a PLUG listing) By the way, 
once you are logged in to the site, you can also run a trace from 
your key to anyone else's key already listed there.

Thanks,
Greg Sabino Mullane greg@turnstep.com
