<h1>Philadelphia Linux <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">GPG</a> Keysigning Parties</h1>

<p>Our current procedure for keysignings is simple and allows for on-the-fly signings if people bring along printouts of their keys.</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload your key to a keyserver
<li>Print out copies of your fingerprint to give out at meeting
<li>At meeting: swap fingerprints and check identities
<li>At home: get keys from keyservers, sign keys, and send signed keys back to their owner
</ol>

<p>Matthew Rosewarne has written detailed instructions for this process:</p>
