<h1>Free Books</h1>

<p>
These books are free to anyone who is willing to write a review of
them.  We'll post the reviews <a href="book-reviews.html">here</a>.

<p> If you want one, please email me, <a
href="mailto:jr-49@purple.com">Jeff Abrahamson</a>.  If you're in the
city, it's easy for us to coordinate book hand-off.  If not, I can
mail it to you (if you paypal me money to cover postage: there are
lots of these books).  If you'll be at a PLUG meeting and coordinate
with me in advance, I can also arrange to have someone at the meeting
have the book for you. Unfortunately, I haven't myself been at PLUG
meetings lately, as I have had classes on Wednesday evenings for the
past several months.

<h2>Available books</h2>

<p>
<ul>
  <p>
  <li><b>J2EE Security for Servlets, EJBs, and Web Services,</b> Pankaj
      Kumar.  ISBN 0-13-140264-1.
      <!-- 3/16/04 -->

      <p>
  <li><b>Next Generation Ajpplication Integeration: from simple
      information to web services,</b> David S. Linthicum.  ISBN
      0-201-84456-7.

</ul>

<h2>Why we have free books</h2>

<p>
The <a
href="http://www.awprofessional.com/usergroups">Addison-Wesley</a> and
<a href="http://www.phptr.com/usergroups">Prentice Hall</a> user group
program gives us books in the hopes that we will provide publicity for
them.

<h2>Writing reviews</h2>

<p> AW/PH has a link about how to write reviews, but it doesn't work
as of the time of writing this paragraph.  In addition to posting your
reviews to the PLUG list, they suggest you post them on <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon</a>, <a
href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/">B&N</a>, <a
href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>, and <a
href="http://www.techbookreport.com/about.html">techbookreport</a> or
any other online locations you like.  Ultimately, do what you like.
The more publicity we give them, the more likely we are to get more
books from them.

<p>
Ultimately, though, please write honest reviews.  Little is gained by
falsely flattering AW/PH.

<p> As an added incentive for yourself, consider linking to the book
using an (amazon, B&N, whatever) affiliate link so that your review
can earn you money.  If you go over a dollar in revenue, it will be
astounding, but I find the (so far theoretical) thought of feedback
can be motivating.
