<h1>PLUG North</h1>
<h4>(Formerly Montgomery County Pennsylvania Linux Users Group)</h4>
<h3>What is PLUG North?</h3>
  <p>PLUG North is exactly what it sounds like, a chapter of PLUG. PLUG members are users of the Linux operating system and other Open Source software who live in the greater Philadelphia area and come together to share knowledge and learn from each other.  The monthly PLUG <a href=/meetings.html>meeting</a> is typically held  on the first Wednesday of the month inside the Philadelphia city limits, and  can be difficult for Linux enthusiasts living in the suburbs to attend. Still, many people do make the trek in every month.</p>
  <p>PLUG North meetings are held in the Northeastern suburbs of Philadelphia, in Plymouth Meeting.  If you are interested in Linux but haven't been able to make it to Philadelphia on a Wednesday evening, you're welcome to come by.</p>

<h3>How do I become a member of this chapter?</h3>
  <p>Membership in all of PLUG is extremely informal, if you subscribe to the <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion list</a> or attend a PLUG (or PLUG North!) meeting you can consider yourself a member.</p>
<h3>How can I find out about PLUG North events?</h3>
 <p>PLUG North shares a mailing list with PLUG and PLUG West. So you can subscribe to the low-traffic <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce">plug-announce</a> mailing list, or to the general <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion list</a>.  (All traffic from plug-announce is forward to the discussion list, so you only need to subscribe to one of these.)  You can also check the list of <a href="/meetings.html">upcoming meetings</a>. </p>
