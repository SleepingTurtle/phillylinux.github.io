<h3>Notes:</h3>
<font color=#000000>Trackers carried by two tasks and observed by a mapping station in a command post can be used to direct one task to another task's location.   The APRS mapping software package XASTIR includes a <b>measure</b> function that provides the distance between two points, the bearing from one to the other, and the area of a NS/EW rectangle enclosed by the points.    A task can be directed to a location by radio even in the absence of landmarks, road signs or good navigational skills on the part of the task members.</font><br>
