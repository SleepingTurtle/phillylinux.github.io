<h1><font color=#FFFF00>A TNC can be programmed as a digipeater (digital repeater)</font></h1><p>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<font color=#000000>A TNC can be programmed to only receive packets, decode them, and pass them on to an attached computer, or it can be programmed to decode packets and retransmit them as a digital repeater.  The repeated packet will have the callsign of the digipeater attached to it as well as the call sign of the station that originated the packet.  In enable a network of digipeaters to retransmit packets but not endlessly retransmit them several protcols have been developed and tested.  The currently advocated proposal involves trackers transmitting packets to a path of WIDE2-2.  </font><br>
