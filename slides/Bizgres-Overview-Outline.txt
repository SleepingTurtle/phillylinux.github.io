Bizgres Overview Outline

1) Description of Bizgres and Its Goals

	a) Greenplum sponsored and community sponsored project

	b) Primary mission is to make PostgreSQL the world's most robust open

	   which will evolve over time

3) Community Composition

	a) Developers on 4 continents (North America, South America, Europe,
	   Asia) including:

		i) Recognized, top developers from Postgres community (Josh
		   Berkus, Simon Riggs)

		ii) Companies heavily invested in business intelligence (Sun,
		    Greenplum, Jaspersoft, Kinetic Networks, others)

		iii) Individual contributors looking for opportunities to
		     contribute to achieving the goals of the community

4) Community Functions

	a) Contribute and maintain code or documentation

	b) Contribute interaction design and usability testing

	c) Report bugs

	d) Test software

	e) Advocate Bizgres, PostgreSQL, and open source in general

	f) Participate in mailing lists

	g) Experiment with the technology 

	h) Help others in the community

5) Leadership

	a) Led by the community itself

	b) Not controlled by Greenplum or any other corporate entity

	c) Minimal unnecessary process or bureaucracy

	d) The developers that make up the project will create a process for
	   organizing project decision making

6) Target users and uses

	a) Mainstream businesses

	b) Primarily for departmental applications

	c) Can also be used for smaller enterprise deployments

	d) Organizations looking for a solid, capable alternative to Oracle,
	   Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft proprietary databases

7) Greenplum's involvement

	a) Create, manage and participate in forums

	b) Provide resources to supply a portion of the development work

	c) Will offer commercial support for DeepGreen PostgreSQL which is
	   based on Bizgres packages

8) DeepGreen MPP

	a) Greenplum's commercial, enterprise-class product (DeepGreen MPP)
	   includes Bizgres packages, along with Greenplum intellectual
	   property, the PostgreSQL core, and additional open source packages

	   parallel version designed for maximum performance and scalability

	c) Runs on commodity servers and delivers unprecedented
	   price/performance

9) Migration Path from Bizgres/DeepGreen PostgreSQL to DeepGreen MPP

	a) DeepGreen PostgreSQL is intended primarily for departmental database
	   applications scaling to around 300 GB of data

	b) DeepGreen MPP is a natural choice for scaling beyond that

	c) Scales to multiple terabytes with extremely fast query speed and
	   general performance

	d) Enterprise class reliability and features
