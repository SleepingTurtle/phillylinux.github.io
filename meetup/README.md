# Meetup Widget # 

Included is the source code from the "custom" widget that is generated from the Meetup Widget Generator. 

This masks API keys and gives us a widget to be included on our site. The code included is a bit more human readable than what is generated from the web page. If you wish to test all changes locally, follow the widget foundry link in the Meetup Widget page on github. 

The Widget Foundry can be found here: https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/foundry/

To use, copy and paste the widget text into the widget foundry, then copy the response.
